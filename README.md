### General purpose cross-language development library
Devs around the world do the same things every day, but with different languages. They perform string operations, validations, data conversions, file operations ... So why should we learn a different library every time we want to do the same on a different language? 
 
TurboCommons tries to standarize all those common operations so they are performed the same way across all possible languages. There's a set of well known common problems, with a set of well known common solutions that are the same for all the programming languages in the world. Our goal is that Php dev who knows this library can start doing the same things with java or C# without having to learn something new. All classes and methods are exactly the same on all the different library languages, work the same way and give the same results.
	
### How we do it
TurboCommons specification is language agnostic. Knowing that all languages do the same general things, we've created a general classification for the different methods classes and utilities.

### How many languages does it support	 
Currently, turbocommons is written in php and javascript, but we want to port it to as many languages as possible. So if you want to translate the library to your language of choice, please contact us and help us build the most standard cross language development library in the world! We're starting so we need your help to port this library to as many languages as possible and test it!

### Current state
The library is currently in an alpha state, so it is possible that lots of things change, but you can find here lots of useful code and solutions to many daily tasks. 

### Support or Contact
We will be really pleased to receive any help, support and comments.
