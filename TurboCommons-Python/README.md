Do you want to translate the turbocommons library to Python?

Help us create the biggest cross language library ever. You simply need to pick the turbocommons PHP version and translate the classes and unit tests to Python.

Why translate from PHP? just because the php version is the one that we use as a reference to translate the library to other languages. 

Please contact us if you want to join our effort!
